# JavaScript Arrays Drills

In this lab, you will practice creating and manipulating arrays in JavaScript. Youâ€™ll start by creating basic arrays, access elements, and then explore how to iterate over arrays using different types of loops. Finally, youâ€™ll work with array methods and practice with an array of objects.

### Instructions:

In **arrays.js**, complete each drill by writing the JavaScript code for the following tasks. Be sure to test your functions by invoking them and checking the console to ensure they work as expected.

---

## Array Creation and Indexing

1. **Create an array named `colors` with five colors of your choice.**

2. **Access and print the first and last elements of the `colors` array.**

3. **Modify the second element of the `colors` array to a new color.**

---

## Loops with Arrays

4. **Use a regular `for` loop to print each element of the `colors` array on a new line.**

5. **Use a regular `for` loop to print the elements of the `colors` array in reverse order.**

6. **Use a `while` loop to print each element of the `colors` array.**

7. **Use a `while` loop to print the elements of the `colors` array in reverse order.**

8. **Use a `for...of` loop to print each element of the `colors` array.**

---

## Nested Arrays (Bonus)

9. **Loop through the nested array using a `for` loop and create a sentence for each subarray.**  
   Example sentence: "This past January I went skiing in Aspen."

---

## Array of Objects Practice

1. **Create an array of objects named `products`. Each object should have a `name`, `price`, and `inStock` key.**  
   Example: `{ name: 'Shirt', price: 19.99, inStock: true }`

2. **Loop over the `products` array and print out the name and price of each product.**

3. **Use a conditional while iterating over the `products` array. If the product is inStock, print out the sentence:**  
   `"The [product name] is available for [price]."`

## Array Methods Practice (Bonus: AI to help you learn and tackle these)

1. **Use the `push()` method to add a new color to the `colors` array.**

2. **Use the `pop()` method to remove the last element from the `colors` array.**

3. **Use the `slice()` method to extract a portion of the `colors` array.**

4. **Use the `splice()` method to remove an element from the middle of the `colors` array.**

5. **Use the `join()` method to convert the `colors` array into a single string.**

6. **Use the `indexOf()` method to find the index of a specific color in the `colors` array.**

7. **Use the `includes()` method to check if a specific color is in the `colors` array.**

8. **Use the `reverse()` method to reverse the order of the elements in the `colors` array.**

---

## Super Bonus: Array Higher Order Methods (Use AI to help you learn and tackle these)

9. **Use the `sort()` method to alphabetically sort the `colors` array.**

10. **Use the `filter()` method to create a new array containing only colors with more than five letters.**

11. **Use the `map()` method to convert each color in the `colors` array to uppercase.**

### Submission Instructions:
- Complete all drills in the file **arrays.js**.
- Test each drill by running your code and checking the output in the console.
- Push your completed work to your repository and submit the link on Google Classroom.
- Be prepared to explain how your code works during a follow-up discussion.

Good luck and happy coding! ðŸš€
